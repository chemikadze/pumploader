PumpLoader for Strava
=====================

Are you a avid cyclist or a runner spending long winter months with gym training? Want to have only one training log? You don't need another gym app account, if you already have Strava!
Having multiple training logs is not convenient and makes uneasy to track your progress, and this gym app will help you to solve this problem. Just install it, track your indoor workout and upload to Strava. You will get following features:

- customizable list of exercises
- manual repetition input
- weight input
- recording time for each reps
- manual time input
- adding user comments

Also it allows to upload workouts to your training log from FitNotes and any other gym apps, that can export data as text.
